### Indoor Navigation App For Android

HACEasyGo application is an efficient, high-resolution innovative indoor navigation application written in Java using Android Studio.
The application is user-friendly, based on the Google Maps platform in tandem with an advanced Graphical User Interface. 
The navigation is calculated using unique methodology, combining data of pre-defined coordinates of the building (underlined data-mining and database designing using SQLite) with real-time signals from wireless access points. 

## Usage

Clone the project and open it in Android Studio.

## Requirements

First, you need to generate a google maps key for android (follow the instructions here [link](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup)). Once you get the key, open the file "[google_maps_api.xml](./app/src/main/res/values/google_maps_api.xml)" (under  "res/values"), then replace __"YOUR_KEY_HERE"__ with it.
